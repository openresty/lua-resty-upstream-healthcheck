Synopsis
========

```nginx

    upstream foo.com {

Description
===========

This library performs healthcheck for server peers defined in NGINX `upstream` groups specified by names.

Methods
=======

spawn_checker
-------------
**syntax:** `ok, err = healthcheck.spawn_checker(options)`

**context:** *init_worker_by_lua&#42;*

Spawns background timer-based "light threads" to perform periodic healthchecks on
the specified NGINX upstream group with the specified shm storage.

The healthchecker does not need any client traffic to function. The checks are performed actively
and periodically.

This method call is asynchronous and returns immediately.

Returns true on success, or `nil` and a string describing an error otherwise.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

status_page
-----------
**syntax:** `str, err = healthcheck.status_page()`

**context:** *any*

Generates a detailed status report for all the upstreams defined in the current NGINX server.

One typical output is

```
Upstream foo.com
    Primary Peers
        127.0.0.1:12354 UP
        127.0.0.1:12355 DOWN
    Backup Peers
        127.0.0.1:12356 UP

Upstream bar.com
    Primary Peers
        127.0.0.1:12354 UP
        127.0.0.1:12355 DOWN
        127.0.0.1:12357 DOWN
    Backup Peers
        127.0.0.1:12356 UP
```

If an upstream has no health checkers, then it will be marked by `(NO checkers)`, as in

```
Upstream foo.com (NO checkers)
    Primary Peers
        127.0.0.1:12354 UP
        127.0.0.1:12355 UP
    Backup Peers
        127.0.0.1:12356 UP
```

If you indeed have spawned a healthchecker in `init_worker_by_lua*`, then you should really
check out the NGINX error log file to see if there is any fatal errors aborting the healthchecker threads.

Multiple Upstreams
==================

One can perform healthchecks on multiple `upstream` groups by calling the [spawn_checker](#spawn_checker) method
multiple times in the `init_worker_by_lua*` handler. For example,

```nginx
upstream foo {
    ...
}

upstream bar {
    ...
}

lua_shared_dict healthcheck 1m;

lua_socket_log_errors off;

init_worker_by_lua_block {
    local hc = require "resty.upstream.healthcheck"

    local ok, err = hc.spawn_checker{
        shm = "healthcheck",
        upstream = "foo",
        ...
    }

    ...

    ok, err = hc.spawn_checker{
        shm = "healthcheck",
        upstream = "bar",
        ...
    }
}
```

Different upstreams' healthcheckers use different keys (by always prefixing the keys with the
upstream name), so sharing a single `lua_shared_dict` among multiple checkers should not have
any issues at all. But you need to compensate the size of the shared dict for multiple users (i.e., multiple checkers).
If you have many upstreams (thousands or even more), then it is more optimal to use separate shm zones
for each (group) of the upstreams.

Installation
============

If you are using [OpenResty](http://openresty.org) 1.9.3.2 or later, then you should already have this library (and all of its dependencies) installed by default (and this is also the recommended way of using this library). Otherwise continue reading:

You need to compile both the [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) and [ngx_lua_upstream](https://github.com/openresty/lua-upstream-nginx-module) modules into your Nginx.

The latest git master branch of [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) is required.

You need to configure
the [lua_package_path](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path) directive to
add the path of your `lua-resty-upstream-healthcheck` source tree to [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module)'s Lua module search path, as in

```nginx
# nginx.conf
http {
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-upstream-healthcheck/lib/?.lua;;";
    ...
}
```
